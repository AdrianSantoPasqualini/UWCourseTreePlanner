This project allows users to select several courses they wish to take and generates intuitive prerequisite trees to show them the courses they must take to be able to enroll in their selected courses.

If a choice for a prerequisite is available, then the user can either specify the choice they want or view the tree for all possible choices.

Update: This was written for the Waterloo Open Data API version 2 which is now deprecated. But the idea for this application (ie one to help UW students plan their courses) lives on in [UWPath](https://github.com/UW-Path) at https://uwpath.live!
